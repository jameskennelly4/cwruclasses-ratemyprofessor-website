Erman Ayday,CSDS233,3,4,"Feb 2nd, 2021","It is clear that Professor Ayday cares about his students. However, he is not the best lecturer and grades are too dependent on the midterm and final (each weighted to a 70% average). Assignments are helpful, but some TAs graded pretty hard. Attend SI sections! The SI was able to guess a bunch of the problems on the midterm/final.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,3,5,"Dec 15th, 2020","Very lecture heavy. All of the grade is based on programming projects, a midterm and final (30%). TA's in the class were tough graders on the programming projects",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,5,4,"Dec 11th, 2020","Go to lecture, try to do the problems he poses in class, try to follow along with lectures. You will learn a lot if you spend the time actually using your brain. I really enjoyed this class and the professor. I do know most of the reviews on here are from when he first started teaching, but he is much much much better now.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,2,4,"Dec 11th, 2020","IDK if it was Zoom learning, but this class was HARD. 6 Assignments + Midterm + Final  YOUR ENTIRE GRADE. Get ready to get really good at programming completely on your own with little help/practice during class.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,3,5,"Dec 9th, 2020","Majority of your grade is determined by two difficult exams curved to an average of 70, so don't expect much help from that. Lectures are fair with Prof Ayday reading off his slides. Homework assignments aren't bad and do actually help you understand data structures. Overall a mediocre class that puts a lot of pressure on the two exams.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,3,5,"Nov 3rd, 2020",Midterm was hard with the class average being in the 70's but he did not grade on the curve. Assignments are alright as you get 2 weeks to do it. Prof was not accommodating to classes being online (at least for international students).,
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,5,3,"Jul 17th, 2020","Prof Ayday is a great professor, the lecture is a bit hard to understand, but the test and final are easy if you do the project and quizzes after class.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS356,5,3,"May 9th, 2020","I took Data Privacy with Erman, which was overall a great class. We had a semester-long project in anything related to Data Privacy, and Erman was always willing to help answer questions or meet with us if we were lost. Lectures were an intro to various data privacy issues, such as voting, genomics, etc, and were quite interesting.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,3,4,"Apr 7th, 2020",He's a 5/10 lecturer and the projects/hw are pretty vague. I had to ask TAs for clarification for almost all of them. The midterm was not as bad as everyone on here makes it out to be. The SI guessed most of the questions. The final was extremely difficult though. He's not great but at least you learn the material elsewhere and still do ok.,
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,3,5,"Nov 20th, 2019","He is an ok teacher and he sometimes throws in jokes that are kinda funny, but in my opinion, his class is quite difficult. Most of your grade is based on his midterm and his finals, and his midterm I thought was decently ok, but I ended up doing poorly on it because he was extremely strict on grading the questions. But he's overall decent.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,2,3,"Nov 20th, 2019","Erman isn't a very good lecturer: he doesn't add anything to the discussion that isn't already on the slides posted on Canvas. The only reason people actually show up to class is because of the pop quizzes. Written assignments/projects vague, very behind on grading, also very dry person in general. However the quizzes/tests this semester are easy.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,2,4,"Nov 19th, 2019","He does not explain the projects well in the description. He gave a great description of big-o notation but after that his lectures started becoming worse. Grades are heavily dependent upon a difficult midterm and final, so even if you have a general understanding of the material, you can still be screwed.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,1,5,"Aug 27th, 2019","Okay I took this class last fall and feel the need to review it based on these (clearly fake and written on the same day by the same person) positive reviews. In short, he's a super bad professor; unclear, not knowledgeable, and gives impossible tests. Avoid.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,1,4,"Jul 28th, 2019","These 5 ratings must came from the same person, which makes me sick. He didn't even taught this class in spring 2019. So fake. As of my own experience with this professor, basically all the low ratings are true. only 1 person out of 135 got 90.02% before curve. I got 84% and I learnt all the stuff online. Trust me, avoid at all cost.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,5,4,"Apr 4th, 2019","Dr Ayday is a great professor. Clear in his explanations. I love his lecture style as he often lets students discuss the solution to a problem which made class engaging. He also explain things well during office hours. Sure the exams are slightly hard, but still manageable. However, instructions for programming assignments were sometimes unclear.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,2,3,"Feb 27th, 2019","Was doing great in the class until final, which had topics never discussed in class. Average score on the final was in the 60s, gave a small curve to compensate but didnt really help.",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,4,4,"Dec 15th, 2018","Perfessor Ayday is pretty approachable. Many people said it is hard to earn an A but I don't think so because it really takes some efforts to learn the materials. Make sure you are connected with TAs and understanding all the stuff. Exams were hard, but was still doable. 3",
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,4,4,"Dec 15th, 2018",His lecture skills needs improvement. The homework were definitely helpful for you to learn the class. 5,
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,1,5,"Dec 14th, 2018",Extremely tough grader. Prepare to learn by yourself. 2,
Erman Ayday,CSDS233,1,5,"Dec 14th, 2018","If you take his class, even if you did very well in all the homework, you still can't get an A in the end!!! 1",
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,4,4,"Feb 3rd, 2021","Be warned that this is not an intro level class. I came in having taken AP Java in HS with an easy A and I still found this class pretty challenging. Connamacher makes himself available often, which is nice, but the grading is not always clear and it takes forever. I did not love this class overall and it's made me think CS maybe isn't for me.",
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,5,4,"Jan 25th, 2021",Amazing professor for an introductory programming class. This course is very hard and challenging but is very manageable as long as you do not do things last minute. I eagerly await another opportunity to take another one of professor Connamachers classes.,
Harold Connamacher,CSDS455,5,4,"Jan 11th, 2021","Graph theory is a very different Connamacher class following a reverse classroom style.  Most of your learning comes from reading textbooks and doing problems before class. Classes are mainly solving problems in small groups collaboratively.  Midterm was difficult but fair, final felt easier. Participation makes up 50% of the grade.",
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,5,3,"Jan 3rd, 2021","He is one of the best CS professors at case for a reason. The amount I learned out of the class was insane, The programming projects were not that difficult and definitely helped to increase my coding ability greatly. Tough class for sure but take it if you really want to learn java.",
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,3,5,"Dec 29th, 2020",The class is mostly watching videos online. Then you are expected to code the entirety of chess without being prepared. Spend 20-40 hours on each project for the unspecific instructions to make you lose stupid points. The labs feel extraneous. A LOT of free points are given which is why there is a 40% A rate. Too much work for a 3 credit course.,
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,5,5,"Dec 16th, 2020","Beginners, heed the warnings. But in case you don't: The first 3 weeks are easy, get the points while you can. Beware of project 4. You will cry. Do the practice problems in the modules, watch the videos, remember the quizzes, take notes on the lectures &amp; don't skip pre-labs. Email Connamacher if you have Qs bc the TAs are slow. Good luck.",
Harold Connamacher,CSDS455,3,5,"Dec 13th, 2020","He didnt teach anything but gave you lots of lots of homework which you will not know the correct answer. Make concepts unclear, make study difficult and unapproachable.",
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,5,5,"Nov 22nd, 2020",Definitely a hard class and LOTS of projects.,
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,5,4,"Nov 4th, 2020","If you havent coded a day in your life this really isnt the class for you. Yes its an intro class but its very fast-paced and concepts can be hard to understand especially if you arent used to thinking logically. With that being said, Connamacher is a great professor. I genuinely enjoy his lectures! advice: start projects early. thats it rly.",
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,4,5,"Nov 4th, 2020",Would Take Again: No,"This class needs an intro class to itself. Professor Connamacher is an amazing, and knowledgeable person. BUT, if you are a novice RUN AWAY! I am not being dramatic. He is pushing you so much, soo many assignments plus, he doesn't provide the correct codes -so that u can discover the knowledge as he says- so you feel lost and unsure all the time"
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,5,3,"May 13th, 2020","Connamacher carries the CS department of CWRU on his back. He's an incredible professor that should be taken by anyone interested in CS at Case. If you want to be successful in his class, start homework and projects early, go to class, and don't copy code. If you do all these things, you will end his class with a high grade.",
Harold Connamacher,CSDS345,5,4,"May 10th, 2020",Professor Connamacher's programming language concepts class was definitely more laid back than his other classes. The class content is mind-blowing at times and there's a lot of in-class coding during lecture. Biggest piece of advice is to get a good group for the interpreter project and start early.,
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,5,4,"Apr 6th, 2020","Professor Connamacher is an amazing teacher. I'm so lucky to have had him. While taking the class, a lot of information is thrown at you, but once you're done you realize how much you know and it really prepares you to succeed. The best advice I can give is start the projects as soon as you get them because they take a lot of thought and refining.",
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,4,5,"Apr 1st, 2020",If you are a novice coder DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I struggled in it as a novice. If you plan on minoring in Applied Data Science take ENGR 131! The class moves at a pace that is WAY too fast for novice coders and doesn't leave any wiggle room to catch up if you fall behind. If you still decide to take the class (like I did) GO TO PEER TUTORING.,
Harold Connamacher,CSDS455,2,3,"Mar 4th, 2020",This class is actually useless. Connamacher does NOT teach anything and he just gives people questions to do during class time. Homework is sometimes too hard he gives full credit if students randomly write things. Tests are decent. Way too easy to get an A. Sometimes he does not know the solutions to the homework since he just randomly pick them.,
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,5,5,"Jan 20th, 2020","In CSDS132, students get lots of project, and the projects are really hard, but the professor himself is such a good professor, fun lectures, mid-term and final are really easy eaxm, so it is not hard to get A",
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,5,4,"Jan 15th, 2020","He's hilarious in his lecture. A real gem in the CS department. However, the materials might be too much for an intro class, but very worth it for future CS courses.",
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,3,5,"Jan 9th, 2020",Connamacher is a decent professor but I felt his class was very hard for novices and the workload was unbelievable. The amount and depth of projects made it hard to reach the deadline. The class is fast paced and if you have no idea what you are doing I suggest reviewing every night and getting help/tutoring often. You need to put in work.,
Harold Connamacher,CSDS340,5,4,"Dec 19th, 2019","Connamacher loves to challenge his students, and I'm a more critical thinker and better problem solver because of it. I would recommend taking Algorithms with friends (or be willing to make friends) because I cannot imagine figuring out the homework on my own. Final was hard and 50% of your grade, but he mainly cares about seeing that you learned.",
Harold Connamacher,CSDS132,5,4,"Dec 9th, 2019","The class is not easy, and the projects take a ton of extra time, but Prof. Connamacher is very accessible and explains things very clearly in lecture. I learned a ton about CS and Java.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,3,"Dec 15th, 2020","Dr. Cavusoglu does a great job explaining such complicated content. Her lectures are wonderful but pretty fast-paced, so watch the recordings back and make sure you get everything she says down. Her lab videos made labs extremely easy and simple and really helped me understand Verilog and assembly language. Do the p-sets to prep for the quizzes!",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,4,4,"Dec 15th, 2020","She is very caring and wants her students to get an A. Gives a lot of extra credit too especially at the end of the semester to make sure students get a good grade. The final was optional. A lot of lectures, basically double of what there normally is in a regular non-remote semester.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,2,"Dec 5th, 2020","Evren is a good lecturer who cares about her students. Quizzes were relatively easy but got more difficult towards the end. The homework was free points. There is lots of extra credit. As someone who was completely new to the topics, it was a bit challenging at times, but the pace of the class was slow enough that I wasnt overwhelmed.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,1,"Apr 27th, 2020","Evren is probably the most caring professor I know. Her teaching style is perfect and I learned so much in the class. Her homework is not too bad, and her labs are easy if you watch her lab videos. She gives previous exams that are really good practice for the actual exams. Her office hours are always crowded because everyone basically loves her!",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,2,"Apr 5th, 2020",Queen Evren passes the vibe check. She actually cares about us and wants us all to have As. I made a mistake on my first assignment and the TA gave me a 75. Evren changed it to a 100 and told me to fix it next time. Once went into her office to talk about my test and she somehow knew exactly who I was and asked me about my career goals. 8/ 0,
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,2,"Feb 28th, 2020","She is an awesome professor who really cares about how her students do in her class. If you meet with her outside of class, she is more than willing to help you with projects and to understand the material. Exams weren't terrible and she gives a lot of extra credit at the end of the semester!",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,2,"Jan 7th, 2020","Evren is an amazing teacher who wants all of her students to understand the course material deeply. She lectures clearly and provides a swath of supplemental resources on canvas. If you show up and pay genuine attention, expect nothing below an A.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,3,"Dec 16th, 2019","Absolutely fantastic professor. Class attendance is not mandatory but I would recommend it. The class becomes much more interesting if you're actually in it. I wish I went consistently earlier in the year. You do have to study for the exams, they're not the easiest but they're not more difficult than most homeworks. Good amount of extra credit.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,2,"Nov 20th, 2019","Evren is the sweetest professor I've even known at Case, motherly even. She is genuinely invested in the success of her students and wants everyone to get an A. Sometimes I show up to her office hours just to chat. Clear and concise lecturer, class expectations made clear, homeworks and tests very easy.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,3,"May 11th, 2019","Professor Evren is extremely caring. The midterms are reasonable and she posts prior midterms as practice. Do the extra credit and make sure to ask her for help on the homework since it 30% of your grade. Keep a very high homework grade, work very hard to ace the midterms and do the extra credit so the stress of finals becomes minimal.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,3,4,"May 6th, 2019","The class was pretty difficult in my opinion, especially the midterms. The pace was also pretty fast. However, she gives you an opportunity for extra credit, and homework assignments are worth a lot (same as the final exam). Also, she is a very nice person; she will explain until you understand.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,2,"May 3rd, 2019","Evren was a really great proffessor! She really cares about the material, and presents it in an interesting and connected way. If you are active in class, she will learn your name fast, even in a big lecture class. She is also really good with pronouns!",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,3,"Apr 28th, 2019","Professor Cavusoglu really cares about students learning the material. She will take the time to get to know you if you talk to her and will be upset when people skip class. If you show up to class consistently, it is more likely she will round your grade up because you demonstrate a good attitude. Whatever you do, DON'T pack up for class early.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,2,"Apr 15th, 2019","The class is pretty straightforward. Very logical, surprise surprise. The professor is accessible at her office hours and offers a TON of extra credit. The material is easy compared to the rest of the CSDS course-work, and it's quite intuitive. The book is a great supplement as the professor lectures assuming that you read the book and know jargon.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,3,"Dec 16th, 2018","Very caring professor! Good lecturer. Sets clear expectations and is accessible outside of class. Although the exams may be difficult, she provides sample exams and lets students replace a test grade with the final exam score. Lots of extra credit at the end of the semester. Recitation sessions are boring, but TAs give out homework answers.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,4,3,"Dec 16th, 2018","Professor Cavusoglu is simply the nicest professor I have ever had in college. Although she may give out pretty difficult exams, she provides a lot of extra credit assignments. She is also very accessible in office hours and is very willing to help. On the other hand, I wish that she could have spent more time on MPLAB programming.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,2,4,"Dec 14th, 2018","The tests were a lot harder than anything we learned in class, and counted for most of our grade. The last unit was very poorly taught. However, the homework assignments were reasonable.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS313,5,4,"Nov 13th, 2018","Very useful &amp; important course. There are weekly quizzes that are pretty hard, so you got to keep up with the material. There are no midterms; just weekly quizzes and a final. This class also uses the same book as CSDS 246, which is nice. Evren does a great job teaching the material, &amp; even gave a review session for the final exam over a weekend.",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,3,"Nov 13th, 2018","CSDS 281 was my intro into CSDS and it is wonderfully taught. The course material is straight forward and very useful down the line. The tests are reasonably difficult, but if you put in the time, you will do fine. She is one of the best professors in the CSDS Department (CWRU is lucky to have her.)",
Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu,CSDS281,5,1,"Apr 16th, 2018",It looks that she is afraid that if you cannot get a A.,
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS310,5,2,"Dec 23rd, 2020","Extremely caring prof and prob the best. He made the boring materials interesting. He nicely structured the algorithm class during pandemic and made the final optional. Homeworks are difficult but he is willing to teach you the hw solutions during office hours. As long as you attend the office hr or watch the recordings of office hr, you are fine.",
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS340,5,2,"May 9th, 2020",Great professor who will help you in and out of class. Do the assignments and understand them and the tests will be easy. Great teacher and person.,
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS340,5,3,"Apr 29th, 2020",Very helpful both in and out of class. Recommended,
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS343,5,3,"Dec 19th, 2019",Mehmet's excitement about data analysis is awesome (goes off on tangents sometimes) and assignments are super useful. He tries to make the material as approachable as possible and has very reasonable expectations. Plus he has a great sense of humor and seems to really care about his students. Took our smaller class out and bought us Mitchell's!,
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS340,5,5,"Aug 27th, 2019","Very clear and interesting lectures that always drew my attention. He is very nice no matter in class or after class. Also, he is hilarious.",

Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS459,5,3,"Sep 15th, 2018","He is very clear in his lectures and they are well presented. He encourages coming to office hours and is very helpful and friendly, someone who is nice to be around.",
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS459,5,3,"Sep 15th, 2018","Simply fantastic professor - never a dull moment in his class, teaches the material amazingly well and gives projects that make you bleed, but ones that also teach you a lot more about CS than anything else could (while balancing it all very well for students).",
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS459,5,2,"Sep 15th, 2018",The only negative thing about Mehmet Koyutürk is that he doesn't teach every course in which I am enrolled. I've never had a more dedicated and engaged professor in our CSDS.,
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS458,5,3,"Sep 14th, 2018","Professor is great in front of the class. Totally engaging. Wonderful, fun, clear lectures.",
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS459,5,3,"Sep 10th, 2018",Prof. Mehmet is the stephen curry in the CSDS department. He know a lot about bioinformatics and machine learning algorithm. You can always learn advanced knowledge from him and his offfice hours is always accessable. Very nice superman!,
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS340,5,1,"Apr 26th, 2018",just awesome,
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS340,5,5,"May 15th, 2017","Koyuturk is equal to or better than Connamacher. Took us out for ice cream/food for participation.  Incredibly caring. Humorous.  Pleasure to attend lectures. Attendance was highest in any CS class I know. Very fair curve, as tests were hard. My favorite class at CWRU.",
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS340,4,4,"May 11th, 2017",He puts learning before everything else which I really appreciate.  The quizzes and tests are graded very harshly but there is a decent curve.  You can also get away with understanding a lot less than you might expect by memorizing how to solve the types of problems given on homeworks and previous exams and replicating them in your  answers.,
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS340,1,3,"Mar 15th, 2017",The lecture dones't help too much but textbook is more reliable. You have to stop by office hour to really get understanding the concept. Hw is not so hard if you read the textbook page by pages,
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS340,1,2,"Dec 17th, 2016",Sometime don't understand his ascent. Lecture is not clear. You could just follw the textbook and save more time.,
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS340,5,4,"Dec 18th, 2014","Great teacher and an even better person. In general, his HWtests aren't easy (ESPECIALLY the midterm+final) but he rewards effort and sometimes curves. Above all he just wants you to know the material, and the level of care he gives students in his office hours shows it. Attendance is recommended since he usually goes beyond what the book teaches.",
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS340,4,5,"Dec 18th, 2014",He's nice just the materials sometimes just weird... You seem to answer it right but it always end up you are wrong,
Mehmet Koyuturk,CSDS340,5,2,"Nov 12th, 2014","Just wow. He takes his students' education more seriously than almost any other faculty member I've seen. He is extremely respectful to students, teaches with so much enthusiasm that it even gets you excited to learn, and has an excellent teaching style. Rewrites exam problems so no past-year cheating and really pushes students to think critically.",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS391,2,4,"Dec 22nd, 2018","His lectures are often confusing and cover very specific examples while failing to actually explain the underlying concepts. Also, his tests have a number of trick questions on them. In the second half, he uses a lot of probability stuff without really going into where he gets his equations.Get ready to read",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS390,5,3,"Sep 15th, 2018","He is very clear in his lectures and they are well presented. He encourages coming to office hours and is very helpful and friendly, someone who is nice to be around.",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS233,5,2,"Sep 10th, 2018",This superman had published Nature literature. He is one of the professor who is underestimated,
Michael Lewicki,CSDS391,5,3,"Sep 10th, 2018","He's a good lecturer, but lectures are straightforward and helpful. homework can be challenging. No doubt, he may be the best expert who know really AI in CSDS department.",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS391,3,4,"Dec 17th, 2017","Lewicki is a brilliant man, but his assignments are legendary for being thoroughly ambiguous. The first half of AI is about average for a CS class, but the second half will rip you a new one if you don't have Discrete and Probability down pat. Start the assignments early and pepper him with questions, or you'll never understand the instructions.Get ready to read",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS345,1,4,"May 8th, 2017","Avoid  345 with Lewicki at all costs. There were multiple occasions where he had to end class early because he was flailing so badly while trying to explain something he had attempted to learn the day before.  He couldn't even explain the solutions to homework problems,  and refused to let us see them (since he was borrowing them from Connamacher).",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS352,1,3,"Dec 8th, 2016","Really bad professor; Reads slides, incorrectly at times, and tries to go as slow as humanly possible to get through lecture. Expectations are not well defined and does not keep to syllabus. He's a smart guy just not built to teach.Get ready to read",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS233,3,3,"Jan 12th, 2016","Lewicki is much maligned among students, for understandable reasons. He's a bit quiet in his lecturing, his voice is  a lullaby, and he takes literal aeons to return assignments. But although he does have occasional errors in his slides, on the whole he's a clear and knowledgeable teacher for those who can stay awake through the lectures.",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS233,3.5,3,"Oct 21st, 2015",Not a great lecturer but expectations are clear and anyone with an aptitude for programming should have no problem with this class.,
Michael Lewicki,CSDS233,3,3,"Apr 13th, 2015","The topic is alright, but lectures aren't engaging. He's very quiet, so it helps to sit nearish the front. I don't think the slides he teaches from are his, as he sometimes seems surprised by what he finds on them. Quizzes were sometimes cryptic and grading on projects was slow.",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS233,1,4,"Dec 3rd, 2014","Don't take class with him. He is often confused during his lectures, often pausing to stare at his own slides. Grading is a nightmare, assignments from months ago still haven't been returned, so good luck learning from your mistakes. I tried to get help from him directly and he laughed at me when I said I didn't know what something was.",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS233,4.5,3,"Jan 16th, 2014","Lewicki is a reasonable professor. He will not blow you away, but, with hard work, an A is easy enough to get. If you have questions, make sure to ask Lewicki and NOT a graduate TA. They have not taken the course, do not go to class, and barely remember the material you're covering. Lewicki, on the other hand, is friendly and helpful.",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS233,2.5,5,"Dec 17th, 2012","Material is simple but the graders appear challenged and routinely mess up assignments.  Getting points back is like asking to remove teeth.

While much of the material is taken from the book, it is never used...ever",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS233,1.5,5,"Dec 13th, 2012","Professor was very quiet and a rather dull lecturer. TA graders repeatedly screwed up my homework, and he made it very difficult to get it corrected once finals were approaching and I needed to get it all corrected. Tests are rather difficult and the one page he allows you is pretty useless.",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS233,5,4,"Dec 12th, 2012","As a CE minor, class was interesting but challenging, grading by TAs appeared to be somewhat arbitrary. Straightforward lecturer, but he does not write his own powerpoints and the code presented is often flawed. Keep on top of the assignments and make sure you study HARD. First HWs are a strong indication of your final grade",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS233,4,2,"Nov 28th, 2011","Good teacher, but a quiet lecturer. Programming assignments are difficult and sometimes unclear, but overall I was satisfied with the class.",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS233,3,4,"Oct 4th, 2011","He admits that he makes assignments ""intentionally vague"". Also isn't an easy grader. I'm pretty good at programming, but this class was difficult for me.",
Michael Lewicki,CSDS233,3.5,4,"Oct 2nd, 2011","No connection with TAs.  Assignments are significantly harder than in previous years.  Doesn't reply to e-mails.  Takes forever to get stuff up.  The TAs don't even seem to know what's going on.  Both books are pretty useless, but you have to buy one only because he refers to small bits of code from it in his assignments.",

Jing Li,CSDS458,1,3,"Mar 10th, 2021",Dr. Li is an incredibly dry lecturer who reads off the PowerPoint slides in a monotone fashion. The homework is completely disjointed from the lecture material.

Jing Li,CSDS343,5,2,"Jul 6th, 2015","Doing the homework, thoroughly, is a must. I recommend LaTeX. The tests can be surprisingly difficult if you don't have the algorithmsproofs internalized but never stray too far from the homework material.",
Jing Li,CSDS343,4,2,"Dec 1st, 2014","Excellent teacher. Even though it is called ""Theoretical"" computer science, everything is mostly applied. He teaches what you need to know, and then you learn it and do the homework. His exams are INSANELY easy, except for his final which you will probably consider one of your hardest finals. Basically do well for the first three exams.",
Jing Li,CSDS340,1,4,"May 8th, 2012","I've had my fair share of bad professors at Case, but Jing Li takes the cake. Difficult accent, useless lectures, and nearly impossible homework.

Jing Li,CSDS343,4,3,"May 10th, 2006","Jing can be a bit hard to understand but he seems to truly care about his students -he individually talked to students 1/2 through to see what they thought about the course.

Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,4,4,"Dec 19th, 2020","Liberatore is really knowledgable in his craft. The course depends heavily on your TA and their grading style.

Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,5,5,"Dec 20th, 2019","He has a very distinctive lecture style which takes some getting used to. However, his lectures are really helpful. The projects are extremely difficult but have to be to actually get people to understand the material. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE if you want any chance of doing well. Most people here are complaining because they think it should be easy.",
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,1,4,"Aug 7th, 2019","Great material, horrible professor. Laughed when I saw the ""clear grading criteria"" tag on this site. Consistently grades on criteria not present in or in direct conflict with criteria in the assignments. He also once gave a guy in my section a NEGATIVE SIX on a project. Choose a small section with a great TA - you'll learn a lot despite the pain.",
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,2,4,"May 6th, 2019","No complaint towards the class material itself at all, very useful class for any programmer who wants to write good code. However, Liberatore and the TA have very different grading standards. So if you get used to how the TA grades you, you will be ripped apart when Liberatore grades you himself. Also no curve at all in the class, a 89.5 is a B.Get ready to read",

Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS477,5,4,"Sep 15th, 2018",Liberatore is an excellent Professor with infectious charisma and a great lecture style. He is one of the only Professors who I thoroughly enjoyed attending his lecture. He cares tremendously about his students and is very fair. I look forward to taking more classes with him in the future.,
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,5,3,"Sep 14th, 2018","Wow! such a clear, brilliant teacher. Every class makes you love the material as much as he does.",
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS428,5,2,"Sep 10th, 2018",The course material that he prepared (several years ago) is pretty much gold; it's possible to not even go to lecture because his notes are that good (and he follows the notes anyways). Beware that his exams are generally harder than his homeworks though.,
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,4,5,"Mar 11th, 2018","The knowledge you gain by taking CSDS293 with him is a ton. He's pretty rough when it comes to looking at your mistakes in your code, but it's worth it. Lectures are just a dry summary of the book. The quizzes are sometimes very hard if you don't read the textbook in depth. Projects take 10-20 hours per week, and graded harshly.",
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS477,3,5,"Jan 3rd, 2017","To be fair the class itself is an amazing class: the materials are great, the way he teaches them is also great. I really got a lot out of this class. No attendance taken but if you miss a lecture you miss *a lot*. His languages are not clear on assignments so make sure you start early and question him constantly on the unclear parts.",
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS477,5,3,"Dec 12th, 2016","The best professor in the CSDS department. Homework is thoughtful rather than busywork (usually). Lectures are interactive. Homework is most the grade. Takes off many points for conceptual mistakes, but very few for computational mistakes. Difficult but in a good way (as grading is still fair; its just the material that is hard).",
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,4,4,"Nov 23rd, 2016","Good professor, responds to emails, explains things well.  He doesn't grade anything, just lectures. You have 2 lectures per week, one quiz per week,and class is cancelled half the time on Fridays. The bulk of the course (75% of grade) are Programming projects, once per week. Get a good TA and it will be enjoyable, although lengthy work.",
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,4.5,4,"Dec 13th, 2015",One of the best CS professors at Case. Don't pay attention to any of the reviews saying to not take this class! 293 is essential if you want to be a great programmer and implement beautiful code (something very appreciated in industry). Assignments take a long time so get started early and pay close attention to his late policy.,
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,2,2,"Oct 6th, 2015","This class is only useful to those computer science majors who don't do programming projects in their own time, otherwise it is just a pain. If you're a computer science major who mainly does programming for classes, this is a great class for practice. It's a shame that you don't develop anything useful, only things to test on unit tests.",
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,2.5,4,"Feb 5th, 2015","Sometimes reads directly from the book rather than lecturing or spends an entire class implementing on example, but definitely knows what he's talking about. Difficult to understand sometimes. This class is definitely a benefit to anyone who wants more preparation for the real world, but only if you're willing to spend 10+ outside of class working.",
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,3,4,"Jan 4th, 2015","Class covers very practical material.  Lectures were almost always straight from the text book (which is provided for free online).  Content was interesting, but often the lectures were slow.  Sometimes you get Friday off.  Weekly projects that take 15+ hours.  Not difficult, just time consuming.  5 person recitation is a code review.",
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,4,4,"Dec 10th, 2014","Must have course for anyone who wants to go into software development. The structure is designed extremely well and you will 100% learn more in this class than 90% of your other CSDS courses. Expect to spend 10+ hours of work a week, but the outcome is worth it.",
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS293,3.5,4,"Dec 8th, 2014","Personally  I don't recommend taking this course, unless you ENJOY programming and ready to spend 10 hrs per week.",
Vincenzo Liberatore,CSDS340,4.5,4,"Dec 7th, 2014","Really great CS professor.  Has some high expectations to drive you, but nothing crushing (except the midterm!  Just accept that that one is gonna happen).  Overall, I think he paces the class well to make sure you really get the material.",
Orhan Ozguner,CSDS397,4,3,"Feb 4th, 2021",Would Take Again: Yes,"Ozguner is a solid professor. He gives clear lectures, and is willing to help students learn by holding office hours during the weekends. His quizzes can be sometimes confusing though, since there may be errors in the questions."
Orhan Ozguner,CSDS341,5,3,"Dec 9th, 2020","Orhan is one of the nicest and most caring professors I've had a CWRU. He clearly knows his Algorithms and is good at explaining the topics with clear notes and examples. He often solves HW problems during office hours and posts the solution on Canvas, showing he really cares that his students know the topic. I hope I have Orhan as a teacher again!",
Orhan Ozguner,CSDS341,5,3,"Dec 7th, 2020","Listen up! Ozguner, G-O-A-T! This class is not hard at all, he gives tons of examples in his slides and works through them in class so people really understand how to do it. AND THEN, he gives almost the exact same questions for homework and tests. Gets grades up on time, and responds to emails so quickly. All in all, would take again if I could.",
Orhan Ozguner,CSDS340,5,5,"Dec 7th, 2020","He is a great professor! Algorithms is notoriously hard, but he makes it interactive and easier to understand. The tests and homeworks are hard, but he will help you if you ask. He follows the pace of the students and really encourages participation in lectures. If he teaches another CSDS class, I'm taking it!",
Orhan Ozguner,CSDS341,2,4,"Oct 7th, 2020","One of my friends described Orhan most accurately when he said ""Orhan keeps teaching us too much and too little at the same time."" Lectures covered a massive variety of information, but that information was never given an opportunity to settle. I learned more from a three hour long SQL crash course than I did from most of a semester of SQL class.",
Orhan Ozguner,CSDS340,4,5,"May 4th, 2020","Professor Ozguner is brand new and it shows. HOWEVER this class is notoriously hard at case and you can tell he put in his best effort to make sure his students understood. Seemed to be following the other algorithm professor's lesson plans, but honestly I have no real complaints. Algorithms is hard but Professor Ozguner made it manageable.",
Orhan Ozguner,CSDS340,3,3,"Apr 6th, 2020","I took Orhan the first semester he was here. For a first timer, he's not bad, but the lack of experience really shows when he tries to get the class to understand material they just don't seem receptive to. He has a tendency to get annoyed, and fail at trying to hide it when students don't get something after a second explination.",
Orhan Ozguner,CSDS297,5,2,"Mar 29th, 2020","One of the best new Prof. I've ever met in this University. Generally, new Profs I've seen were either not giving a sh*t to student performances or just bad at teaching. But Orhan has structured the course well, and really cares about how his students are doing. Also, the HWs are reasonable.",

H. Andy Podgurski,CSDS442,1,4,"Apr 11th, 2019","Course content is quite interesting. It is his style of delivering made the the course hard and boring. Notes/slides are barely comprehensible. There is usually one quiz every one or two week, which comprises a large part of the grade.",
H. Andy Podgurski,CSDS393,3,4,"Mar 21st, 2019","Not a fan of the structure of this class. If you're a senior then you've already learned about software engineering practices from internships in which case this class is redundant.

Big points for checking the boxes in this class.",
H. Andy Podgurski,CSDS444,4,1,"May 26th, 2015","Somewhat boring but very straightforward and gives examples where he can. Disappointing lack of in-class demos.

H. Andy Podgurski,CSDS393,4.5,3,"Dec 21st, 2014",Grades mostly by pop quizzes but they're always at the end of class and possible to anticipate. Lectures are dry but the concepts are very important for software development so attendance is recommended. Very funny. The project was a lot of work but the actual code we wrote didn't end up mattering too much.,
H. Andy Podgurski,CSDS233,3.5,1,"Nov 19th, 2009",Monotone due to a speech impediment and reads off of slides. Makes some hilarious jokes. Somewhat absent minded(forgot he had class once).

Shuai Xu,CSDS302,5,2,"Apr 28th, 2020","Professor Xu is a young, funny teacher who genuinely cares a lot about both the content and his students. His lectures are straightforward and follow the book for the most part so if you're confused its easy to catch up. Homework of moderate length is assigned weekly from the book but does a pretty good job of preparing you for the test.",
Shuai Xu,CSDS395,4,2,"Dec 19th, 2019","Did senior project with him. Grading is pretty lenient; it's not hard to get an A. Pick a good group and come up with an idea that seems doable in a semester and you'll be fine. My one complaint is that he was kind of hands-off and didn't really interact with us beyond the proposal, giving little feedback on the progress reports.",
Shuai Xu,CSDS395,4,3,"Dec 10th, 2019","Took Senior Project with Prof. Xu - the class is mostly independent work (only have to attend the first and last weeks), but he's pretty good at giving feedback/explaining what he wants. The class is really what you make of it. You're required to work in a group, so find a good group. And talk to him/the TA if you're confused about an assignment.",
Mark Allman,CSDS325,1,3,"Nov 3rd, 2019","Future students deserve to know the truth about Allman's class, which is why it's absurd my earlier comment was deleted. Our projects didn't relate to the material, his grading scheme made no sense and he didn't grade the last half of the class until the final, and he had a very weird dynamic with a few students in the class which was distracting.",
Mark Allman,CSDS325,5,4,"Dec 6th, 2018","Mark's lectures are awesome, and he really wants everyone to understand the material. He explains the material really well and makes sure the lectures are engaging (and witty). The tests and projects are really hard, but they really push you and make sure you have truly mastered the material.",
Mark Allman,CSDS325,5,5,"Jul 24th, 2017","This class was definitely one of the toughest classes I have taken during my time at Case, he definitely does not make it easy but he loves the topic and he truly does want every student to succeed if you put in the work. Funny guy but pushes you to be the best you can be, actually learned something from his tests and projects.",
Mark Allman,CSDS325,5,5,"May 8th, 2017","Networks with Mark Allman may be one of the  most difficult classes you will take at Case. He definitely doesn't design his tests and projects to be easy, but they are worth doing. I learned more in this class than I have in most. Mark really cares about students and will push you to be the best you can be.",
Nick Barendt,CSDS377,5,4,"Apr 20th, 2020","The course taught me so much. It was a lot of work but the material is very applicable to the real world.

Nick Barendt,CSDS377,5,4,"Aug 7th, 2019","Though this course gave me about 10 hours / week in homework, I've been able to stump senior engineers with the knowledge I gained in this class.

Nick Barendt,CSDS377,5,4,"Nov 7th, 2018","Amazing, caring professor. Super accessible over Slack, understands the material deeply and has a justification for everything. Passionate about the content and the course. You will learn more than your last 5 CSDS courses worth of content in a semester.",
Sanjaya Gajurel,CSDS342,3,2,"May 8th, 2020","I thought the class was fine. The information he provides on his slides is really good though, the assignments are straightforward applications of that. The final project and take-home final also weren't too bad, but did require a fair amount of time to complete. Nice guy, you can tell he cares but you can also tell it's his first time teaching.",
Sanjaya Gajurel,CSDS342,2,3,"May 4th, 2020","You can tell he has never taught a class before. Lectures are messy and hard to understand. You will learn most of the material through the homework. Nonetheless the slides are good to look at if you want to learn, but going to lecture will just confuse you.",
Roberto Galan,CSDS131,2,4,"Aug 28th, 2019","Professor Galan obviously pretty adept in his field. However, this does not mean he's a good teacher. His lectures are boring and considering it's one of the lowest level c.s. courses, professor Galan makes it way too hard. He even curves at the expense of the students if the grades are too high.

Ronald Loui,CSDS338,5,3,"Dec 19th, 2020","Loui's class was one of the most enjoyable I've taken at Case! He gave time in class for students to chat amongst ourselves and with him before lecture begins, and even relaxed assignment intensity during the election period.

Ronald Loui,CSDS397,1,1,"May 10th, 2020","He cares more about the image and culture of programming rather than actual programming or competence.

Ronald Loui,CSDS397,5,2,"May 10th, 2020","Even though his class isn't hard, I ended up learning a ton! The notes on his site are great. Grade was mostly made up of 3 projects and some quizzes (with all questions given ahead of time).

Ronald Loui,CSDS397,5,1,"May 8th, 2020","He is a nice guy and I learne a lot from his class. He always makes the lecture interesting by telling his story and his experiences, which I think is helpful.

Negative.)",
Marc Buchner,CSDS313,5,4,"Apr 19th, 2010","Great lecturer, knows signals inside and out. Lectures are easy to follow, even if dense with information.

His teaching style was going directly over code, word for word.  This class was especially painful because, as a game programming class, it could have been fun.",
Marc Buchner,CSDS290,4,1,"Apr 2nd, 2008","Class is excruciatingly boring.  Programs are ridiculously time-consuming, but not 'hard' per se.  Take this if you want an interesting class but have plenty of free time.",
Marc Buchner,CSDS290,3,3,"May 30th, 2007","He's an okay professor.  He certainly seems to know his stuff, but his teaching is mediocre.  While going to see him for help can sometimes be fruitful, sometimes he leaves you with a lot to try to figure out on your own.  The projects (the later ones, at least) are very open-ended but can be very time-consuming.  However, they are very rewarding.",
Marc Buchner,CSDS396,4,3,"Nov 10th, 2006","Great guy who cares about students, but I dunno if he's really figured out how run a gaming course yet.  I'm sure once the class has been around a little while longer it'll make more sense.  I found it doubtful that he could beat up a bear, however, so that goes against him.",
Marc Buchner,CSDS396,4.5,2,"Dec 17th, 2005","Buchner was really on the ball with this new program (and the VW lab)--once the course gets better refined/defined, it will be even more fun.  Great guy, very nice and you could tell he cared",
Vira Chankong,CSDS352,5,4,"Jun 20th, 2020","Vira can be difficult to understand, but he cares about his students, and it shows through his leniency on grading and willingness to provide extra time to complete assignments. Probably should also take an esl course.",
Vira Chankong,CSDS407,4,4,"Dec 21st, 2019",A lot of assignments and most of them are tedious. They take you around 5 hours to finish per week. As a computer science student I really don't get why is this class CSDS. As an open elective it is fine if you want to know some basic concepts about finance and taxes.,
Vira Chankong,CSDS302,2,1,"Nov 20th, 2019","Vira is the dryest lecturer at CWRU - it's no wonder hardly anyone shows up to lecture. Class moves incredibly slowly and it bored me to tears. Homework is long and takes a while, but pretty easy. Tests are a joke. If you want an easy A and a filler class, this is it; if you're looking to solidify yourself as a mathematician look elsewhere.",
Vira Chankong,CSDS302,4,1,"May 17th, 2019","Chankong makes Discrete just about the easiest math course you'll ever take. The weekly homework can be long but there are a ton of online resources out there. Tests are very easy if you go over the practice problems and the textbook slides he posts. Lectures are dry, but I found them to be most effective when I just sat back and relaxed.",
Vira Chankong,CSDS304,4,2,"Apr 30th, 2019",Tests worth 80% of grade but HW is easy and very reflective of tests. Dry and slow lecturer but easish class.,
Vira Chankong,CSDS324,1,4,"Nov 13th, 2018","He is unclear with the material, which you wouldn't expect since he repeats himself on basic facts multiple times a lecture for multiple lectures. He is often late to lecture and holds the class after the lecture period has ended. He often stops mid sentence and makes false statements occasionally. He seems overall unprepared for lectures. 2",
Vira Chankong,CSDS304,5,2,"Nov 12th, 2018",Topics are covered thoroughly in class and he assigns a lot of weekly homework. 53,
Vira Chankong,CSDS302,2,2,"Nov 12th, 2018","Easy class, but a lot of hw. Don't take this in a semester where you have a lot going on. 4",
Vira Chankong,CSDS302,3,3,"Aug 28th, 2018","If you can take Discrete with Connamacher instead, do it. It'll be harder but much more worth your time. If you can't, Chankong is a solid second choice. Long homework, but straightforward exams and a nice curve at the end make for an easy A if you put in some effort on homework. Read the book and the lecture slides, they help more than his notes.",
Vira Chankong,CSDS302,3,3,"May 11th, 2018","Professor Chankong is a very nice man, but it is sometimes hard to follow along due to the language barrier. Lectures are often dry, too. A lot of people skip class. The homework may seem excessive, but it is good preparation for the exams.",
Vira Chankong,CSDS302,4,2,"May 8th, 2018",Would Take Again: Yes,"Not bad at all. Pretty lenient in grading the tests. Attendance is not mandatory but try to follow his class because the class actually makes sense, although it might not be interesting. Do all the homework and do it well. You will definitely learn a lot in class and get a decent grade.Get ready to read"
Vira Chankong,CSDS304,4,2,"Dec 22nd, 2017","The homework is hard, but you can find much of it on Chegg. Tests are very straightforward, with averages being 87 and 81. However, the tests are about 25 percent of your grade and only a few questions, so if you mess up a question, it hurts a lot. Class is not necessary. Chankong will post practice questions for the tests if you ask.Would take again",
Vira Chankong,CSDS304,4,3,"Oct 29th, 2017",A very nice guy. He gives a lot of homework but definitely not a tough grader.,
Vira Chankong,CSDS324,4,4,"Jan 10th, 2016","Chankong's lecture is boring but he put all information and details we need to know in it. His hw is extremely long and some of them are very challenging, but I enjoy doing them. I spent avg about 10 hours every week on his class and if you don't understand the material, GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS. If you are prepared for it, easy A.",
Vira Chankong,CSDS324,1,4,"Dec 9th, 2015",Vira Chankong should not teach. Its that simple his lectures are slow confusing and are full of errors or missed information. He can occasionally be helpful during office hours but more then half the time i had to explain to  him how matlab or math worked before he realized that he is wrong.  If you could avoid him everyone would,
Vira Chankong,CSDS324,1,5,"Nov 28th, 2015","One of if not the worst class taken at Case.  A very low percentage of the class attends lectures because you will learn nothing.  The homework is what makes this class so horrible though.  The quantity and level of difficulty is INSANE, surpassing any course I have ever taken by a landslide, and worth 10% of the final grade.  Exams are hard too.",
Vira Chankong,CSDS352,1,4,"May 6th, 2014","Assigns way too many HWs which are too long. He never covers everything he plans to in class. The book is barely used, don't buy it. He expects you to learn from his notes and there is a language barrier that makes that difficult.",
Vira Chankong,CSDS416,1,4,"Apr 21st, 2014","Huge language barrier and totally disorganized lectures make it impossible to learn from this man.  Barely uses book: expects you to learn from notes/slides, but notes/slides have numerous typos in critical formulas/algorithms.  Homework is 15% of grade but there's tons and it takes forever to do, mainly because he doesn't cover things he wants to.",
Vira Chankong,CSDS324,1,3,"Dec 11th, 2013",Very unclear lecturer. Constantly seems unprepared for class and notes/slides have numerous typos and inconsistencies. He doesn't seem to care whether students learn or are interested in the class. Assignments are very long but not weighted accordingly. Very unclear expectations about course.,
Michael Fu,CSDS290,4,2,"Aug 25th, 2020","Solid teachers. Cares about students and the game industry. Is nice and respectful. Class can be a bit random or slow, but I found it interesting, helpful, and enjoyable",
Michael Fu,CSDS390,4,3,"Nov 13th, 2017","You have to show up every Thursday to give an in person progress report. Groups are of about 15 people including CS and CIA art students. The professor gives good feedback and is helpful. No tests or lectures or anything, just all work time. I highly recommend this class even if you aren't into gaming.",
Michael Fu,CSDS290,2,3,"May 4th, 2017","This class was so unprepared. The lectures taught me nothing, the homework was basically large ""debugging"" projects, and the final project was riddled with technical errors and was very rushed. Honestly, I think the TA did more work for this class than Fu did. Luckily he graded incredibly easily.",
Michael Fu,CSDS290,2,3,"May 4th, 2017","The professor was very unprepared for each lecture. He did not teach for much of the class period. Half of each class was spent on either student presentations or youtube videos about game design. I felt that these were just ways for him to teach less. Furthermore, we did not receive any grading criteria for homework projects until very very late.",
Michael Fu,CSDS290,3,2,"Apr 27th, 2017","He gave a lot of work for the nature of the class. Lectures didn't seem to help, and he wasn't prepared for class. We ended up teaching ourselves how to use Unity to make games. We spent most of the time in class listening to other students give presentations. He did not give us rubrics for assignments until the day it was due, and not enough time.",
Satya Sahoo,CSDS302,4,4,"Dec 8th, 2016","Professor Sahoo taught Discrete Mathematics very well. He was thorough in his explanations, and he took all questions no matter how trivial. His homework assignments were structured well and meant to help us learn. His exams were not easy, but they were reasonably difficult and enjoyable to take. Grading was very fair.",
